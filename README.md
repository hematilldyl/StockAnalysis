# StockAnalysis

An exploration into Monte Carlo simulation used to conduct a what if on an index portfolio as well as any stock desired. Also contains
an LSTM model that will fit to the stock trend and predict the trend as it goes as a behaviour model, used mostly to practise using
an LSTM for time-series predictions.
